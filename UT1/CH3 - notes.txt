Project blastoff:
	a.k.a project kick-off, project initiation, project launch
	Deliverables:
		Scope
		Stakeholders
		Goals
		Purpose
		Constraints
		Names
		Relevant facts and assumptions
		Estimated cost
		Risks

Setting the scope:
	Can be done via analyzing data flows between activities
	Context diagram: Diagram of data flows between activities

Cost estimations:
	Methods:
		Loose method:
			Count the number of I/O interactions
			Watch proportions I/O-cost of previous projects
			Apply rule of three
		More accurate method: Involves number of business events
		Event more accurate method (Function point counting)
	Methods must be based on measurement

Risk management:
	Should be done by a risk-assessment person
	Determine:
		Potential problems
		Likelihood of becoming problems
		Strength of the problems
		Early signs

Final decision:
	Involves analyzing final deliverables
	Objective decision based on facts
	Other techniques:
		Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats
		Advantages, Limitations, Unique qualities, Overcome limitations
		Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Traceable
		Political, Economic, Sociological, Techonological, Legal, Environmental factors
		Customers, Actors, Transformation processes, World view, Owners, Environment

Blastoff meetings:
	It's about knowing:
		Scope
		Stakeholders
		Users
		Constraints
		Naming conventions
	Alternatives (must be seen by all key stakeholders):
		Write a business plan
		Use feasibility studies

1#Sketch
Communicate some aspects of a system
The essence is selectivity
Supposedly the most common
Informal and dynamic

Behavioral modeling
Conceptual modeling
Software modeling

4#Behavioral modeling
Interaction diagrams
State diagrams
Activity diagrams

:6
4#Conceptual modeling
Description of the concepts of a domain of study
Building a vocabulary about a domain

:7
4#Software modeling
Elements of UML map into software

:8
3#MDA
Standard approach to using UML to program
Uses UML as basic modeling language

Platform Independent Model

:11
9#PSM
Platform Specific Model

:12
3#Executable UML
Directly from PIM-like diagram to deployable system
Simpler than full UML
Compilers

12#Compilers
Based on archetypes

:14
1#Completeness
Communicate all design decisions of a system or subsystem
The essence is completeness
CASE tools

15#Examples
Forward-engineering tools
Reverse-engineering tools
round-trip tools
tripless tools

:17
16#Forward-engineering tools
Support diagram drawing
Back it up with a repository

:18
16#Reverse-engineering tools
Read source code
Generate diagrams from it

:19
16#round-trip tools
Do forward-engineering
Do reverse-engineering

:20
16#tripless tools
Use source code as repository
Use diagrams as graphic viewport on the cdode
Can be integrated with programming editors

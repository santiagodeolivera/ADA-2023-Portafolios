FC: Fit criteria

12.

Req. description -> Rationale -> Fit criterion -> Test case

Fit criteria and rationale
Fit criteria: Determines how to determine whether the requirement is satisfied
Rationale: Reason for the requirement to exist

For NFR yielded by a blog, determine its fit criterion
Write the "test case"
 Requirements don't have test cases, they have fit criterion

Defining a measurement for a requirement can be hard

Rationale:
 Facilitates finding of fit criteria
 Facilitates decision-making
 Improves test-making

Derive fit criteria from description and rationale.

Scale of measurement
 The numbers must come from informed decisions

Fit criteria for NFR

Subjective tests:
 Req. testing method
 Involves prototypes
 Cost-effective

Types of NFRs
 Standards
 Look and Feel Requirements
 Usability and Humanity
 Performance
 Operational
 Maintainability
 Security
 Cultural
 Legal

Look and Feel Requirements
 Subset of UX?

Usability and Humanity
 Subset of UX?

Operational
 Related to environment
 Related to adjacent systems

FRs
 Involve an action the product must complete
 Depends on satisfying an autority of such
 Fit criterion does not indicate **how** the req. is tested
 If req is "the product shall check...", FC is "The checked data conforms with [authority]"
 If req is "the product shall calculate...", FC is "The result conforms to [algorithm]"

Test case
 Convienent to make at early stages
 Testers can collaborate in making them

Forms of FC
 Text
 Graphic

Text FC: Requires objective definition of all terms

Graphic FC:
 Decision table
 Graph

Use cases and FC
 Use cases are groups of requirements
 Outcome is its FC
 Should be found early on, during blastoff

Project purpose is FC of whole project
